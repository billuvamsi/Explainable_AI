# GradCAM Implementation on Shenzhen-Hospital-CXR-Set

Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping(Grad-CAM), uses the gradients of any target concept (say ‘dog’ in a classification network or a sequence of words in captioning network) flowing into the final convolutional layer to produce a coarse localization map highlighting the important regions in the image for predicting the concept.
